# Hello GCP!

Hi everyone!

Due to COVID and other distractions, I have not blogged in months.  I am about to change that, and like many others, put energy into making 2021 a **much** better year than 2020.

I have recently accepted a position to work at Google Cloud Platform (GCP), after nearly five years at Amazon Web Services (AWS). I am so excited to work on a new platform, particularly one as sophisticated as GCP.

This also means that I will be slowly shutting down my old [blog](https://www.nickaws.net) in order to spend more time on this one.  This blog will be generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted on GCP.  I will migrate my old content here over time, so nothing will be lost.

I hope to document my GCP learningse and more interesting customer issues here. As I am new to GCP, I imagine many of my discoveries will be "old hat" to most.  Still, I think that my experience at AWS and at GCP will allow me to make interesting comparisons between the platforms regardless.

Here's looking towards a **better** 2021 for all of us!
