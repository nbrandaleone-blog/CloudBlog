# Why use GCP?

I am often asked why use one cloud provider over another. What are the fundamental differences?
I think that the following quote from a well known Developer Advocate (Microsoft no less!) really
helps to answer that question.

> Google is such a developer-focused cloud. You code everything first, and then the tools come later, if ever.
> Even though their cloud is really powerful and really scalable, that's just not the paradigm. Whereas
> AWS is a DevOps cloud, and I think that's been one of the drivers of their success, around data in particular, 
> because the network admins and DBAs have more references.

However, I think that might be the wrong question. Going forward, Enterprises will be 
using AWS and GCP (and other cloud providers) in some sort of multi-cloud or hybrid solution.
As good as any of these providers are, it seems somewhat short-sighted to put all your assets on one platform.
Clearly, Docker and Kubernetes, which allows for code portability will enable this business requirement.
